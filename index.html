			<p class=DragonNormal>Throughout the ages, tales of Dragons have infused the
			legend and lore of the realms of lesser beings.  In the land of Merisyl there
			are more to Dragons than simply tales.  Dragons are a day to day presence, and
			their influence is felt in all aspects of life.</p>

			<p class=DragonNormal>The rippling flight of a brass Dragon might cast a shadow
			over the coast of Haaven as fishermen set out to gather the morning catch.  The
			rampaging of a blue may send ripples through the fields of corn about her
			lair.  Humans and demi-humans of Merisyl have grown up with Dragons as their
			neighbors, their hunters and occasionally, their prey.</p>

			<p class=DragonNormal>The political and religious structures of Merisyl have
			developed around the predominant Dragon species of the geographic area, and the
			culture and attitude of the citizens often follows that of their Draconic
			counterpoint.  Indeed, in some lands the Dragons themselves participate in the
			human and demi-human governmental structures.  In others, however, the Dragons
			are content to hold themselves above the law.</p>

			<p class=DragonNormal>Across all of Merisyl it is not uncommon to encounter
			Dragons in humanoid form… sometimes to satisfy curiosity, sometimes for sport. 
			Like people, dragons are varied in their interests.  They may pursue a
			dalliance with a mortal, enjoy a mug of ale in a tavern, or attempt to trade
			with those not comfortable dealing with Dragons in their natural form.  The
			people of Merisyl can never be sure when a Dragon walks amongst them.</p>

			<p class=DragonNormal>With Dragons so much a part of the world of Merisyl one
			might think that they have curtailed the development of any creatures which
			might compete with them in strength.  In fact, that is not the case.  The
			quantity and proximity of Dragons with such disparate temperaments has caused
			them to ignore people, and concentrate primarily on their Draconic rivals and
			human devotees.  Mystic creatures with great physical and magical strength roam
			the world, and the cities of the lesser races, acclimated by the majestic and
			overawing presence of Dragons, are accustomed to these as a matter of course.</p>

			<p class=DragonNormal>Scholars disagree as to whether the innate magical
			energies of Merisyl attracted the Dragons, or whether their presence of Dragons
			has infused the land with their power. The fact remains, though, that magic is
			both strong and common.  Most people are born with at least one innate power,
			and few are impressed by a show of magical prowess.</p>

			<p class=DragonNormal>One theory suggests that when the ancient race of
			Pacantryx died off that they were no longer able to serve as the stewards of
			the natural energy of Merisyl.  Without this stewardship, magic became both
			strong and unpredictable.</p>
