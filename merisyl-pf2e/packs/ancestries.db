These individuals must earn respect from the Ixen &ndash; it will not be given based on reputation, or bought with gifts.&nbsp; Respect, once earned, is not easily lost, and those lucky enough to be befriended by a Ixen find themselves with a loyal and true companion for the remainder of their years.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"561\">Ixen who remain in exclusively Ixen-populated areas tend to be very xenophobic or insular.&nbsp; This is due to the importance their culture places on self-sufficiency and the stigma associated with dependence on others.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"778\">As young adventurers Ixen can make frustrating and obnoxious companions and their distrust of other races and vanity cause tensions.&nbsp; However, groups that adventure with a Ixen over long periods of time find themselves relying on their keen minds, and developing an unshakable bond of trust and respect.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div data-layout-column=\"true\" data-column-width=\"50\">\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1085\">&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1109\">You Might...</p>\n<ul data-indent-level=\"1\">\n<li>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1125\">Look down upon others until they prove themselves to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1186\">Find comfort in great heights or open air.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1232\">Have a tendency to speak verbosely and with very deliberate enunciation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Others-Probably...\" data-renderer-start-pos=\"1308\">Others Probably...</h3>\n<ul data-indent-level=\"1\">\n<li>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1330\">Think you&rsquo;re pretentious or obnoxious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1372\">Assume that you can&rsquo;t stand cold temperatures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1422\">Respect your authority on linguistic subjects.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Physical-Description\" data-renderer-start-pos=\"1472\">Physical Description</h3>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1494\">Their slight frame and membrane connecting the limbs to the torso are efficient at dispersing heat into the air, which is crucial when in their native habitats of the volcanic regions of Merisyl.&nbsp; Their pebbled, lizard-like orange skin is tougher than it appears, contributing to their natural armor class and granting resistance to heat and fire. Their bodies are hairless with the exception of a wiry mane-like crop of hair from the top of the head to their shoulder blades.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1972\">The large surface area created by the tall stature and membranous skin of the Ixen gives them the ability to glide from great heights, and in their native regions they can ride updrafts from the volcanic vents.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that same surface area makes them susceptible to low temperatures.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"2267\">Their fine features are almost Elvish in appearance, but their reptilian skin and taloned hands look draconic.&nbsp; Academics who postulate a Dragon-Elf heritage are dismissed by the Ixen as fools.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"2462\">The average height range for both male and female Ixen is 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; to 7&rsquo;6&rdquo;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Society\" data-renderer-start-pos=\"2535\">Society<button></button></h3>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"2544\">Ixen are comfortable in any region where the temperature does not frequently dip below freezing.&nbsp; They can tolerate extreme heat (up to the boiling point of water) with no penalties or ill effects.&nbsp; Their preferred lands are volcanic regions with active geothermal vents, which can allow them to glide with ease.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"2858\">Historically the Ixen have always lived in close proximity with Red Dragons.&nbsp; They have cultivated a working relationship with these vain and ferocious marauders, and as a result have come to make cultural choices which ease those relationships. Ixen are typically organized into monogamous life-long relationships responsible for rearing children.&nbsp; Most Ixen families raise one or two children and no more, but in rare cases families have been known to have as many as 12 children.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"3342\">Ixen speak Ixenic as their native tongue, and most also speak Draconic and Trade Common.&nbsp; The Ixenic tongue sounds somewhat Draconic, but with softer vowels and fewer hard consonants.&nbsp; The written form of Ixenic uses the Draconic alphabet.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"3583\">Many Ixen worship <a title=\"/wiki/spaces/MP2/pages/2006417409\" href=\"https://merisyl.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MP2/pages/2006417409\" data-renderer-mark=\"true\">Nuvria</a>, Goddess of Solitude.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Names\" data-renderer-start-pos=\"3631\">Names<button></button></h3>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"3638\">Ixen typically have three names.&nbsp; Their first name identifies their city or region of birth, their second name identifies their family, and their last name is given by their parents.&nbsp; By friends they are called only by their given name.

This chitin can be any of a rainbow of hues.&nbsp; The forearms and lower legs are adorned with spines along the outside, and the hands have three digits (two fingers and a thumb) that end in razor-sharp claws that can aid in climbing.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"Society\" data-renderer-start-pos=\"1909\">Society</h1>\n<div data-layout-section=\"true\">\n<div data-layout-column=\"true\" data-column-width=\"66.66\">\n<div>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1920\">The Korthjach are most comfortable in swamps, fens and forest regions.&nbsp; They are the dominant race of Verthis, with the cities of Verr, Hesarux and Sjachothar being their major centers of population.&nbsp; Kethend, in the Aurix Resplendency and Levir in the Dominion of Rach are also predominantly Korthjach communities. The Korthjach can also be found in most other cities of Merisyl, and scattered in small communities throughout the woodlands and swamps.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"2374\">The Korthjach are reclusive, and as such have made very little effort to create or maintain relationships with other races.&nbsp; The other non-draconic races are largely indifferent to them, and the draconic races range from suspicious to hostile. The Korthjach do not recognize Dragons as a superior race, and as such are in the minority of the races of Merisyl.&nbsp; Indeed, even good Dragons are miffed at what they perceive as a slight. Dragons tend to treat Korthjach without the same paternal amusement that colors their relations with the other races of Merisyl.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"2937\">All Korthjach speak Korthan and most speak Draconic.&nbsp; Some also speak Trader Common, though the softer sounds are not easy for the Korthjach to form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"3090\">Some Korthjach worship Dragons gods as do most of the peoples of Merisyl, but most worship Vivlorean, the Korthjach Goddess of life, death, rebirth and renewal.&nbsp; They see the tenets of her faith reflected every day in the circle of life and death in the swamp. The plants and insects of the swamp are nourished by the bodies of the previous generations of life.&nbsp; There is no good or evil, law or chaos in this. It simply is.

While outsiders view this as a &ldquo;Chief&rdquo;, a better translation from the Tamgolin language is &ldquo;Guide&ldquo;.&nbsp; This leader is responsible for providing advice and support for their family.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"2239\">For most societies their tales of ancestral upheaval are the stuff of storybooks and legends. For the Tamgol it is specific and recent - something the eldest lived through first hand. The events around Mezrek&rsquo;s attack on Merisyl and <a title=\"https://merisyl.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MP2/pages/1311309877/History+Timeline#Return-of-Litoriath\" href=\"https://merisyl.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MP2/pages/1311309877/History+Timeline#Return-of-Litoriath\" data-renderer-mark=\"true\">Litoriath&rsquo;s re-ascendency to the Pantheon</a> to defeat him impacted the Tamgol in a dramatic and unprecedented fashion.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"2591\">They convened the most honored of their Guides and came together for a giant Sharemeet. After a great deal of discussion and debate, they came to the conclusion that their practice of isolationism and self-sufficiency left them unable to influence a complex world in the wake of immense change. Without understanding and influencing the so-called &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; world, who could say what a mess of it these other races might make of things. Many Tamgol bundled up their few worldly possessions and set off to deliberately integrate themselves with the broader world. Their vision was to attempt to form Clans inclusive of other ancestries and to serve as Guides to the unfortunate of the world without them - those they called the &ldquo;Lost&rdquo;.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"3333\">That Sharemeet (now often referred to as the Great Trade) was a contentious affair with a sizable contingent of Tamgol preferring the simplicity of their woodland existence to the danger presented by the larger races. Still others held that interacting with the world was fine - but they should be expected to follow Clan Rights. Those with more exposure to the world told a story of people with no clans to support them, no Guides to aid them and a lack of appreciation for their daily experiences. Famously, Guide Arkavix presented it to the sharemeet this way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"3902\">Imagine that you have woken up and are alone. You can no longer breathe in the crisp refreshing scent of a pine wood on a winter day. You no longer truly appreciate the succulent juices of a marinated steak grilled over an open flame. You have no Clan to aid and comfort you. You have no Guide to call upon for help. It is you against the world in all of its naked cruelty. This is what the Lost of Merisyl face each and every day. This is what we can lead them from. They need us as cubs need suckle. Let us leave the broken shelter of our forests and caves; let us channel this flood of humanity to water the crops of peace; let us go forth and Guide the Lost to the comfort of a Clan!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"4593\">After 10 days of vigorous discussion (punctuated with 9 nights of exquisite cuisine) a decision was reached. Those who wished to step into the world as Guides would be given the blessings and supplies to do so.</p>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"4806\">Less than a year after the Rise of Litoriath groups of Tamgol begin showing up in towns and cities across Merisyl, offering to help, to learn&hellip; and to Guide. While the initial integration was awkward and full of misunderstandings and mishaps, the Tamgol and the Lost have become used to one another over the intervening few dozen years. There are now adult Tamgol born into the cities of Merisyl who have known no other life.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div data-layout-column=\"true\" data-column-width=\"33.33\">\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-panel-type=\"info\">\n<div>\n<h2 data-renderer-start-pos=\"5237\">Sharemeet</h2>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"5248\">A sharemeet is a Tamgol ceremony which is part festival and part bazaar. During sharemeets the rules of Clan Rights (see below) are extended to all attendees of the sharemeet. These sessions can run days, and the Guides from the various clans meet to negotiate treaties, mediate disagreements and share stories and information.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div data-panel-type=\"info\">\n<div>\n<h2 data-renderer-start-pos=\"5581\">Clan Rights</h2>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"5594\">Clan Rights are complex and somewhat situational, but generally can be summarized with these principles:</p>\n<ul data-indent-level=\"1\">\n<li>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"5702\">Do no harm mentally, spiritually or physically within your clan.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"5770\">The good of the clan comes before the good of the individual or the good of other clans.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"5862\">Do no physical harm to other clans, save in defense of your clan&rsquo;s well-being.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"5944\">Possessions belong with those with the wits to hold them. (This simplifies a complicated concept: theft within a clan is strictly forbidden as mentally damaging, but theft across clans simply proves that the need of the &ldquo;winning&rdquo; clan was greater than that of the &ldquo;losing&rdquo; clan).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"6227\">Treasure your experiences, as they are what makes life worth living.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div data-mode=\"wide\">\n<div data-layout-section=\"true\">\n<div data-layout-column=\"true\" data-column-width=\"66.66\">\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2 id=\"Alignment-and-Religion\" data-renderer-start-pos=\"6304\">Alignment and Religion<button></button></h2>\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"6328\">Tamgol can be any alignment or religion, but tend to put a high premium on the balance of nature and the importance of structure, leaning towards Lawful Neutral.
